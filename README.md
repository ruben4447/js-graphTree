# js-graphTree
A graph/tree builder written in JavaScript.


The following algorithms are supported:
  - **Dijkstra** - *[graph]* find the shortest path around a graph.
  - **Breadth First** - *[graph; tree]* list nodes in a graph/tree by exploring all nodes at the present depth prior to moving deeper.
  - **Depth First** - *[graph; tree]* list nodes in a graph/tree by starting at a node and exploring as deep as possible along each ranch before backtracking.
  - **Tree Test** - *[graph]* test if the given graph is also a tree by checking that no loop exists
