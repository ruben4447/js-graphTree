# js-graphTree
A graph/tree builder written in JavaScript.


The following algorithms are supported:
  - **Dijkstra** - find the shortest path around a graph.
  - **Breadth First** - list nodes in a graph/tree by exploring all nodes at the present depth prior to moving deeper.
  - **Depth First** - list nodes in a graph/tree by starting at a node and exploring as deep as possible along each ranch before backtracking.
  - **Tree Test** - test if the given graph is also a tree by checking that no loop exists
  - **Kruskal's** - return minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm
  - **Primm's** - return minimum spanning tree using Primm's algorithm with a distance matrix
  - **Pre-order Traversal** - traverse nodes of a tree in the order: current, left, right
  - **In-order Traversal** - traverse nodes of a tree in the order: left, current, right
  - **Post-order Traversal** - traverse nodes of a tree in the order: right, left, current
